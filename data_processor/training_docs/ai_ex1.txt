        ## Project Description

        TopicModelAI is an Artificial Intelligence project that specializes in topic modeling. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to automatically extract and identify topics from a given text corpus. This project is particularly useful for tasks like content recommendation, document summarization, and understanding the main themes within a collection of documents.

        ### Key Features

        - Automated topic extraction from text data
        - Support for various topic modeling algorithms, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
        - Customizable parameters for fine-tuning topic extraction
        - Visualization tools to explore and understand the identified topics

        ### Motivation

        The motivation behind TopicModelAI is to simplify the process of topic modeling, making it accessible to researchers, data scientists, and developers working with textual data. By providing an easy-to-use AI model, we aim to assist in uncovering valuable insights within unstructured text.

        ## Installation

        To get started with TopicModelAI, follow these installation instructions:

        ```bash
        # Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TopicModelAI.git

        # Navigate to the project directory
        cd TopicModelAI

        # Install dependencies
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        ## Usage

        Using TopicModelAI is straightforward. You can use it to extract topics from your text data as follows:

        ```python
        from topicmodelai import TopicModel

        # Create a TopicModel instance
        model = TopicModel()

        # Fit the model to your text data
        model.fit(text_corpus)

        # Extract topics
        topics = model.extract_topics(num_topics=5)

        # Visualize the topics
        model.visualize_topics()
        ```

        ## Dataset

        For this example, we have included a sample dataset (`sample_data.txt`) to help you get started. However, you can use your custom dataset by replacing the `text_corpus` variable in the code snippet above with your own text data.

        ## Example

        Check out the [example notebook](example.ipynb) for a step-by-step demonstration of how to use TopicModelAI on the sample dataset.
