        ## Project Description

        ImageClassifierAI is an artificial intelligence project designed for image classification tasks. It utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize and classify objects within images. This project is particularly useful for tasks like image recognition, content tagging, and object identification.

        ### Key Features

        - Pre-trained models for quick deployment
        - Support for custom model training on new image categories
        - An easy-to-use API for integrating image classification into your applications
        - Visualization tools for model performance and analysis

        ### Motivation

        The motivation behind ImageClassifierAI is to provide a versatile and accessible tool for image classification. We aim to make state-of-the-art deep learning models available for a wide range of applications, from identifying objects in photographs to automating image tagging processes.

        ## Installation

        To get started with ImageClassifierAI, follow these installation instructions:

        ```bash
        # Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageClassifierAI.git

        # Navigate to the project directory
        cd ImageClassifierAI

        # Install dependencies
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        ## Usage

        Using ImageClassifierAI is easy. You can use it to classify images as follows:

        ```python
        from imageclassifierai import ImageClassifier

        # Create an ImageClassifier instance
        classifier = ImageClassifier()

        # Load a pre-trained model
        classifier.load_model("resnet50")

        # Classify an image
        result = classifier.classify_image("image.jpg")
        print(result)
        ```

        ## Dataset

        For image classification, you can use your custom dataset by organizing it into appropriate folders (one folder per class) and then using it for model training. Refer to the [documentation](docs/dataset_setup.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your dataset.

        ## Training

        If you wish to train your own image classification model, refer to the [training documentation](docs/training.md) for step-by-step instructions and best practices.

        ## Evaluation

        To evaluate the performance of your trained models, we provide evaluation tools and metrics. Refer to the [evaluation documentation](docs/evaluation.md) for more information.

        ## Contributing

        We welcome contributions to improve ImageClassifierAI. Whether it's bug fixes, new features, or documentation enhancements, please feel free to contribute by opening issues or pull requests on our GitHub repository.
