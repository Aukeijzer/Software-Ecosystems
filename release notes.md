# Realised Features
- The product will focus on an ecosystem-wide perspective, which means that it will not delve into individual projects. It will instead focus on project clusters and will thus always be aggregated.  

- Apply timed data to give the user insight regarding the growth of a certain topic in an ecosystem.  

- Utilise automated thematic analysis, specifically topic modelling, to identify prevalent themes within different software ecosystems.  

- Showcase information such as the total amount of topics, projects, contributors and contributions belonging in an ecosystem.

- Showcase the top 5 languages, topics and contributors in an ecosystem. 

- Offer admins the ability to customise dashboard outlays, change ecosystem descriptions and create new ecosystem dashboards.
